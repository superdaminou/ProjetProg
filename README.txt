II. How to build your project and play ?

CMake is used to build this project. Build directory will contain your executables.
Place yourself in the PROJECT ROOT and run theses instructions to generate Makefiles :

- mkdir build
- cd build
- cmake ..


By now Makefiles should be created. Then, to create executable and libgrid.a (grid library) :

- make

To run all tests easily :

- make test

If you want to check detailed tests :

- cd test
- ./test_grid
- cd ..

If everything passed successfully, you can now play :

- ./play

Use Z, Q, S, D to play. Good luck !
Use A to generate a random session.

If you want to play with graphic mode, you must have SDL2 installed on your computer.
Then :

- ./playGraph

Use arrows to play.
Press R to restart your game, press A to generate a random session.
